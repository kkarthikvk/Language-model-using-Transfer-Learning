#LANGUAGE MODELING :

Language modeling (LM) is the use of various statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. Language models analyze bodies of text data to provide a basis syntax and semantics of a sentence. To learn a literature we need to perform a language model with that literature so that it would learn the context words of the specified target word . Even while fine-tuning the weights with our domain dataset . we need to first fine tune with language model to know about our dataset and context words .
